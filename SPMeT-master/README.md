## Executive Summary
This repository provides Matlab code for the Single Particle Model with Electrolyte & Thermal Dynamics (SPMeT). A diagram of the SPMeT is below. The SPMeT can be run and edited from filename [spmet.m](spmet.m). The SPMeT model code is based upon the equations in the publications below.

This repository also contains Matlab code for the SPMe, i.e. isothermal conditions with no temperature dynamics. The SPMe can be run and edited from filenames [spme.m](spme.m).

### Features
Specifically, the code models the following dynamics:  

* Solid-phase lithium diffusion
* Surface and bulk concentrations of lithium in solid-phase single particles
* Electrolyte-phase lithium diffusion
* Two-state thermal dynamics (jelly roll & can)
* Temperature-dependent parameters
* Optional SEI layer growth aging submodel
* Voltage

#### Detailed Features
* Concentration dependent exchange current density
* Concentration dependent electrolyte diffusivity
* Concentration dependent electrolyte conductivity
* Concentration dependent electrolyte activity coefficient function  

#### Features not included
* Concentration dependent solid phase diffusivity
* Multiple particle sizes / chemistries
* Aging mechanisms besides anode-side SEI layer growth

### Inputs
The SPMeT requires the following inputs:

* __Parameter file:__ A parameter file in directory ``/param`` which provides model parameter values that correspond to a particular chemistry. For example, [params_LCO.m](params_LCO.m) provides model parameter values for a graphite anode/lithium cobalt oxide cathode.
* __Input current trajectory:__ A definition or input file in directory ``/input-data`` that provides a time series of electric current applied to the battery cell model in terms of A/m^2.
* __Initial conditions:__ Initial conditions values for the state variables. These include:
  - Voltage ``V0``: Initial voltage. Variable ``V0`` and the moles of solid phase lithium ``p.n_Li_s`` in the parameter structure together are used to compute initial conditions for solid phase lithium ``csn0`` and ``csp0``
  - Electrolyte concentration ``ce0``: Initial concentration of lithium ions in the electrolyte, e.g. ``p.c_e`` from the parameter structure, in units of [mol/m^3]
  - Jelly Roll Temperature ``T10``: Initial temperature.
  - Can Temperature ``T20``: Initial temperature.
  - SEI layer thickness ``delta_sei0``: Initial thickness
 
### Outputs
The SPMeT simulates the following outputs:

* __Bulk State-of-Charge__ ``SOC_n``, ``SOC_p``: Bulk SOC in anode and cathode, respectively. ``SOC_n`` is the typical SOC value reported in any battery-powered device.
* __Voltage__ ``V``: Terminal voltage of battery with SPMe.
* __SPM Voltage__ ``V_spm``: Terminal voltage of battey predicted with SPM model (i.e. without electrolyte subsystem).
* __Solid-phase Lithium concentrations__ ``c_n`` and ``c_p``: Concentration of lithium in the solid phase of the anode and cathode, respectively, as a function of time step ``1:NT`` and radial distance ``r_vec``. Units are [mol/m^3].
* __Surface concentrations of Lithium__ ``c_ss_n`` and ``c_ss_p``: Concentration of lithium at SURFACE of solid phase particles in the anode and cathode, respectively, as a function of time step ``1:NT``. Units are [mol/m^3].
* __Electrolyte-phase Lithium concentrations__ ``c_e``: Concentration of lithium in the electrolyte phase, as a function of time step ``1:NT`` and distance across cell sandwich ``x_vec_spme``. Units are [mol/m^3].
* __Temperatures__ ``T1`` and ``T2``: Temperature of the jelly roll and metal can, respectively. Units are [K].
* __SEI Layer Thickness__ ``delta_sei``: Thickness of SEI layer on graphite anode. Units are [m].

### Visualizations
To visualize the SPMe simulation results, run the following code:

* [plot_spmet.m](plot_spmet.m): Generates one static figure with (i) current, (ii) surface concentrations, (iii) temperatures, and (iv) voltage.
* [animate_spmet.m](animate_spmet.m): Generates an animated figure with (i) solid-phase lithium concentrations, (ii) electrolyte phase concentrations, and (iii) voltage.

### Numerical Method Parameters
The solid and electrolyte phase PDEs are solved with the central difference method and second-order accurate boundary conditions to ensure conservative solutions (i.e. conservation of matter). The accuracy / simulation speed can be adjusted by changing the following parameters.

* ``p.delta_t``: Time step in [sec]. Default: 1 sec
* ``p.Nr``: Number of nodes in finite discretization of single particles. Default: 30
* ``p.Nxn``: Number of nodes along x-coordinate in Anode. Default: 10
* ``p.Nxs``: Number of nodes along x-coordinate in Separator. Default: 5
* ``p.Nxp``: Number of nodes along x-coordinate in Cathode. Default: 10
